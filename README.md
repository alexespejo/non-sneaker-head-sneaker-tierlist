### S-Tier 
1.  **_Converse, Chuck 70_**: Inexpensive for a durable comfortable shoe, also has wide foot option
2.  **_New Balance, 993_**: Very expensive but for insanely noticeable quality of materials, build, and comfort, also has wide foot option
3.  **_New Balance, 574_**: Inexpensive alternative to the 990 series but still a quality shoe and comfort that exceeds the - relatively - inexpensive price

### A-Tier 
1. **_Crocs, Clog_**: Idk, crocs

### B-Tier 
1. **_Onitsuka Tiger, Mexico 66_**: Cool looking shoe with vintage history, but inaccessible in the U.S and sacrifices the vintage aesthetic for comfort
2. **_New Balance, 550_**: Also cool looking shoe with a vintage history, well constructed but difficult to break in

### C-Tier
1. **_Doc Martens, Adrian Loafers_**: They look cool at a glance but breaking them in is extremely painful (literally), required me to leave in a summer heated car for ~2 weeks till the leather was soft enough that it wouldn't blister my feet
